# SlackBot
Repo for the Chatbot used in the devsoc slack

You need to be added to the Heroku to deploy, although anything that gets pushed to master should deploy automatically, so try not to break it...

##Currently deployed on the Devsoc Telegram! (not the slack)

It's based on Hubot: https://hubot.github.com/ <-loads of stuff to help you learn how to develop for it there
